# 🤖 Android System Design Roadmap (For Android Developers)

## 🎯 Goal:
To help Android developers evolve from app builders to system designers who can architect scalable, performant, and maintainable mobile systems integrated with real-world backends.

---

## 🔹 Phase 1: System Design Fundamentals (Week 1–2)

### ✅ Objectives:
- Understand what "System Design" means in a mobile context.
- Learn the core concepts of client-server architecture.

### 📚 Topics:
- Client-Server vs Peer-to-Peer
- REST vs GraphQL
- JSON vs Protobuf (for efficient mobile communication)
- Stateless vs Stateful APIs
- Network layer lifecycle (HTTP, TLS, etc.)
- API throttling, retries, rate limiting

### 🛠️ Tools:
- Postman, Insomnia, Charles Proxy

---

## 🔹 Phase 2: Android App Architecture (Week 3–4)

### ✅ Objectives:
- Learn scalable app architecture patterns.

### 📚 Topics:
- MVVM, Clean Architecture
- Repositories, UseCases, DTOs & Domain Models
- ViewModels, LiveData, Flow, StateFlow
- Dependency Injection (Hilt, Dagger, Koin)
- Separation of Concerns (SoC)

### 🛠️ Tools:
- Jetpack libraries (ViewModel, Room, Navigation, DataStore)
- Architecture Components
- Modularization (dynamic feature modules)

---

## 🔹 Phase 3: Networking & API Communication (Week 5–6)

### ✅ Objectives:
- Build a robust, fault-tolerant network layer.

### 📚 Topics:
- Retrofit & OkHttp best practices
- Interceptors & Auth token handling
- Pagination strategies (offset, cursor)
- API error handling strategies
- Secure token storage (EncryptedSharedPreferences, Keystore)

### 🛠️ Tools:
- Retrofit, OkHttp, Moshi/Gson, Chucker

---

## 🔹 Phase 4: Local Storage & Offline Strategy (Week 7–8)

### ✅ Objectives:
- Build offline-first experiences that sync data when online.

### 📚 Topics:
- Room Database, DataStore
- Repository pattern with local + remote source
- Sync strategies (one-way, bi-directional)
- Conflict resolution & merging strategies
- Network-bound Resource Pattern

### 🛠️ Tools:
- Room, DataStore, WorkManager, ConnectivityManager

---

## 🔹 Phase 5: Scalable Feature Design (Week 9–10)

### ✅ Objectives:
- Build features that scale to millions of users.

### 📚 Topics:
- Background Work (WorkManager, Foreground services)
- Push Notifications (FCM)
- Analytics & AB Testing (Firebase, Mixpanel)
- Lazy loading / infinite scroll

### 🛠️ Tools:
- Firebase, Remote Config, Firebase A/B Testing
- Paging 3 Library

---

## 🔹 Phase 6: Performance Optimization (Week 11)

### ✅ Objectives:
- Build responsive, efficient, battery-friendly apps.

### 📚 Topics:
- Memory leaks and how to prevent them
- Cold start & ANR optimization
- App size optimization
- Reducing battery usage
- Network performance tuning (caching, compression)

### 🛠️ Tools:
- Android Profiler, LeakCanary, StrictMode
- Lint, ProGuard, R8

---

## 🔹 Phase 7: CI/CD, Modularization, and Team-Scale Design (Week 12)

### ✅ Objectives:
- Prepare apps and teams for large-scale collaboration.

### 📚 Topics:
- Gradle best practices & build optimization
- CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Bitrise, Jenkins)
- Feature modularization & dynamic delivery
- App signing, versioning, and release channels
- Feature flags & remote config

### 🛠️ Tools:
- GitHub Actions, Firebase App Distribution, Fastlane
- Dynamic Feature Modules

---

## 🔹 Phase 8: System Design Practice & Interviews (Week 13–16)

### ✅ Build & Design:
- Messaging App (WhatsApp clone)
- Ride-sharing tracking system
- Background upload/download service
- Note-taking app with offline sync and conflict resolution

### 🧠 Skills to Practice:
- Sequence & flow diagrams
- Database schema design
- Caching layers
- Data syncing strategies
- Multi-process architecture (for media, downloads, etc.)
