# 📱 Mobile System Design Roadmap (For Flutter & Mobile Developers)

## 🎯 Goal:
To help mobile developers understand how to architect scalable, maintainable, and high-performance mobile systems with backend interaction, caching, offline-first behavior, scalability, and clean modular structure.

- Learn architectural fundamentals.

### 📚 Topics:
- Monolith vs Microservices (High-level)
- Client-server architecture
- REST vs GraphQL
- HTTP lifecycle
- JSON vs Protobuf
- Mobile-specific challenges (limited memory, battery, network issues, offline-first)

### 🎓 Resources:
- [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)
- Gaurav Sen’s YouTube Channel
- [High Scalability](http://highscalability.com/)

### 📚 Topics:
- SQLite vs NoSQL (Isar, Hive)
- Repository pattern with caching
- Network-bound resource pattern
- Background sync strategies

### 📦 Packages:
- `isar`, `hive`, `moor`
- `connectivity_plus`, `flutter_cache_manager`

---

## 🔹 Phase 5: Scalable Features & User Growth (Week 9–10)

### ✅ Objectives:
- Handle large user bases and scalable app features

### 📚 Topics:
- Lazy loading & infinite scroll
- Push notifications (Firebase, OneSignal)
- In-app purchases
- Analytics, AB testing

### 🛠️ Tools:

### 📚 Topics:
- Memory management
- Startup time optimization
- Jank reduction
- Code splitting
- Battery and network usage reduction

### 🛠️ Tools:
- Flutter DevTools
- LeakCanary (Android), Instruments (iOS)

---

## 🔹 Phase 7: Designing for Scale & Teams (Week 12)

### ✅ Objectives:
- Think like a system designer in large teams

### 📚 Topics:
- Modularization and feature folders
- CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Codemagic)
- Architecture documentation
- Versioning & release cycles
- Localization & internationalization

---

## 🧪 Phase 8: Case Studies & System Design Interviews (Week 13–16)

### ✅ Projects:
- Design a WhatsApp Clone
- Design Uber-like tracking
- Subscription Tracker App
- News Feed with Reactions

### 🔍 Focus On:
- Database schema design
- Flow diagrams & sequence diagrams
- API contract design
- Offline sync logic
