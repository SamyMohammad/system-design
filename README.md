Absolutely, here's a structured Mobile-Focused System Design Roadmap tailored for Flutter/mobile developers aiming for senior-level proficiency:

📱 Mobile System Design Roadmap (3–4 Months)
🎯 Goal:
To help mobile developers understand how to architect scalable, maintainable, and high-performance mobile systems with backend interaction, caching, offline-first behavior, scalability, and clean modular structure.

🔹 Phase 1: System Design Foundations (Week 1–2)
✅ Objectives:
Understand what System Design means in mobile context.

Learn architectural fundamentals.

📚 Topics:
Monolith vs Microservices (High-level)

Client-server architecture

REST vs GraphQL

HTTP lifecycle

JSON vs Protobuf

Mobile-specific challenges (limited memory, battery, network issues, offline-first)

🎓 Resources:
System Design Primer

Gaurav Sen’s YouTube videos

“High Scalability” blog

🔹 Phase 2: Mobile App Architecture (Week 3–4)
✅ Objectives:
Learn clean modular architecture for mobile

Understand layers: Presentation, Domain, Data

📚 Topics:
MVVM & Clean Architecture

Repositories, UseCases, Mappers

Dependency Injection with get_it or riverpod

State management (Cubit, Riverpod, Bloc)

SOLID principles

🛠️ Practice:
Refactor a small project to clean architecture

🔹 Phase 3: Networking & API Design (Week 5–6)
✅ Objectives:
Build robust network layers

Handle errors, retries, timeouts

📚 Topics:
Designing mobile-friendly APIs

Authentication flows (JWT, OAuth2)

Pagination, caching, and batching requests

API versioning

Rate-limiting

🔧 Tools:
dio, http, chopper

Postman/Insomnia

🔹 Phase 4: Local Storage, Caching & Offline Strategy (Week 7–8)
✅ Objectives:
Design for offline-first experiences

📚 Topics:
SQLite vs NoSQL for mobile (Isar, Hive)

Repository pattern for caching

Network-bound resource

Background sync

📦 Packages:
isar, hive, moor

connectivity_plus, flutter_cache_manager

🔹 Phase 5: Scalable Features & User Growth (Week 9–10)
✅ Objectives:
Understand scalability strategies on mobile

📚 Topics:
Lazy loading / infinite scroll

Push notifications (Firebase, OneSignal)

In-app purchases

Analytics & AB testing

Tools:
Firebase, RevenueCat, Mixpanel

🔹 Phase 6: Performance & Optimization (Week 11)
✅ Objectives:
Learn how to diagnose and fix mobile performance issues

📚 Topics:
Memory management

App startup time optimization

Reducing jank

Code splitting

Minimizing network and battery usage

Tools:
Flutter DevTools

LeakCanary (Android), Instruments (iOS)

🔹 Phase 7: Designing for Scale & Teams (Week 12)
✅ Objectives:
Think like a system designer in a large team

📚 Topics:
Modularization and feature folders

CI/CD for teams (GitHub Actions, Codemagic)

App architecture documentation

Release management & app versioning

Internationalization and localization

🧪 Phase 8: Case Studies & Mock System Design Interviews (Week 13–16)
✅ Projects:
Design a “WhatsApp clone”

Design an “Uber-like tracking system”

Design a “Subscription Tracker” (your app)

Design a “News Feed with Reactions”

⚙️ Focus On:
Database schema design

Flow diagrams

Sequence diagrams

API contract design

Offline sync logic

📌 Key Takeaways
Topic	Skills Acquired
App Architecture	Clean code, modularization
API & Networking	Offline-first, retries, batching
Storage & Caching	Data consistency, background sync
System Scalability	Lazy loading, push, auth, analytics
Team-scale Design	Feature modules, CI/CD, performance

🎁 Bonus Tips
Participate in open-source Flutter projects with solid architecture.

Practice whiteboard design on Excalidraw or Whimsical.

Review apps like Notion, YouTube, or Instagram to analyze how they are designed.
